# R.Deauth
This script is a whole bunch of WiFi / internet hacks in one 

This is a simple basic script I made because I was bored and thought it might be a cool idea...

It used programs like mdk3, airmon-ng and macchanger to do its tasks

1) git clone https://github.com/rustywolf021/R.Deauth
2) cd R.Deauth
3) chmod +x RDeauth.sh
4) sudo ./RDeauth.sh
5) install
Then from there see if you have all the requitred tools and if not install them...
